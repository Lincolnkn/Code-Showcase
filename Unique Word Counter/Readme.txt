Grade Given: 95%

Assignment objective:
You must write a program which reads, processes and reports on the contents of a text
file.

Your program should:
1. 	Read the name of the text file from the console.
2. 	Read in a text file, not all at once. (This can be line by line, word by word or
	character by character.)
3. 	The file content must be converted to a sequence of words, discarding
	punctuation and folding all letters into lower case.
4. 	Store the unique words and maintain a count of each different word.
5. 	The words should be ordered by decreasing count and, if there are multiple
	words with the same count, alphabetically. (This ordering may be achieved as
	the words are read in, partially as the words are read or at the end of all input
	processing.)
6. 	Output the first ten words in the sorted list, along with their counts.
7. 	Output the last ten words in the list, along with their counts.
