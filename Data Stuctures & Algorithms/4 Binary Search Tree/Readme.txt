Data Structures & Algorithms - UOW 203 Lab 4: 
Grade Given: 100%

Assignment objective:
For this exercise, you are to implement BST sort and test it for correctness.

The file contains a sequence of integer values. Read them and construct a binary search tree from
the values in the order they are read. Thus; the first number read will be the root of the tree.

You do not need to balance the tree as you construct it.
When you have read the last value into the BST, conduct an in‐order traversal to output the values in
ascending order.
Print them 10 to a line in a 5‐character wide field.
