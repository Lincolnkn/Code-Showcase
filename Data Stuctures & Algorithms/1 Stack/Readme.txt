Assignment objective:
Stack

The first entry in the data file contains the initial stack size
The remaining data will consist of a set of lines containing either:
push value
or
pop
with what should be the obvious activity associated with each input â€“ either pushing value onto the
stack or popping the current top value off the stack.
You should start with a stack array of the specified size.
If you attempt to push data onto a full stack you should
Create a new array of twice the current size,
Copy the data from the old stack to the new stack,
Delete the old stack.
Each time this doubling occurs you should output a line to the console of the form:
Stack doubled from old_size to new_size.
If you attempt to pop an empty stack no action should be taken, Do not print an error message.
At the end of the input file you should print a final line of the form:
Stack contains n entries.
This is the only output required.
Example:
If the input file looked like:
2
push 1
push 1
push 1
push 1
push 1
pop
pop
push 1
the output would be:
Stack doubled from 2 to 4.
Stack doubled from 4 to 8.
Stack contains 4 entries.
Note that you do not need to shrink the stack at any time.
